By merging [Noto Sans VF](https://github.com/googlefonts/noto-fonts/tree/master/phaseIII_only/unhinted/variable-ttf) and 小米兰亭 Pro VF, successor of [小米兰亭](http://www.miui.com/zt/miui8/index.html), Noto Milan has huge variety of weight.

![Preview](poster/waterfall.png)

## Choose Your Flavor

Noto Milan has many pre-defined weights and 3 regional variants.

### Weights

Noto Milan defined 745 weights: all integers from 116 (included) to 860 (included) are valid weights.

Non-integer weights can be built by customizing `configure.py # class Config # fontPackWeight`.
(See below # How To Build.)

### Regional Variants

GB and OSF are variants that supports a superset of Chinese national standard GB 18030-2000.

|     | European                             | 中文                             | 한국어 |
| --- | ------------------------------------ | -------------------------------- | ------ |
| GB  | Mainland China (UI)                  | Mainland China                   | N/A    |
| OSF | Mainland China (UI, Oldstyle Figure) | Mainland China (Oldstyle Figure) | N/A    |

RP is a special offer for Chinese RP realms. The RP distributions aim at unified experience for roleplaying players by mapping `丶` to the same glyph as `·`, allowing character names like “伊利丹丶怒风” to be shown as “伊利丹·怒风”.

|    | European                | 中文                | 한국어 |
| -- | ----------------------- | ------------------- | ------ |
| RP | Mainland China (UI, RP) | Mainland China (RP) | N/A    |

* European: English, Español (AL), Português, Deutsch, Español (EU), Français, Italiano, and Русский.
* UI: Ambiguous punctations are treated as Western.
* RP: `丶` (U+4E36) is mapped to the same glyph as `·` (U+00B7, MIDDLE DOT).

小米兰亭 Pro VF is bundled in MIUI 11 releases.

With a Xiaomi phone, you can upgrade to such release, and simply run

```bash
python configure.py
```

Put `MiLanProVF.ttf` to `milan/`, then `make` your flavor:
